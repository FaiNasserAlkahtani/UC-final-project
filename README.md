MEEM's Cake 

# Idea
problem: in cake small buisness, managing orders can be exhausting spicially when there is only one employee in the staff. reciving the order , preparing it, modifying and customizing the cake and the packeging, packing and delivering is a lot of work that can be reduced by using an application for ordering cake.
specially in seesons like Kuwait national day celebrations in February, حفلات التفوق في المدارس , Eid, weddings and birthdays the number of orders and the customization needed for every order can be overwhelming. not to mention the bills work that needed be done. 
solution:
an application for ordering cake that allow customers to order cake, ask for the customization they want, specify the date of delivary they desire, add their contact information, pay, recive their orders with minimal need for contacting with buisness owner. the admin of the application can view a neat document with all orders, each along with its details.
